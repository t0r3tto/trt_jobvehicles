This resource is specifically made for QBox users since many scripts directly access SQL tables, which is bad practice and often doesn't work properlyâ€”99% of the time.

It provides a job vehicle system that allows players with certain jobs and ranks to create and spawn owned vehicles from designated locations.
For example, LEO-type jobs can have their own vehicles, instead of having to spawn and customize them each time. Might add a limit if requested in the future.

## Features

- Job & rank based vehicle spawning access
- Multiple jobs & different vehicle lists can be easily added
